Of course. Here is a complete Product Requirements Document (PRD) for the MVP of your conversational MLOps agent, based on our discussion.

## Product Requirements Document: Conversational MLOps Agent MVP

* **Version**: 1.0
* **Date**: October 2, 2025
* **Status**: Proposed

### 1. Introduction

**Problem**: MLOps workflows are powerful but notoriously complex. Data scientists and ML engineers must interact with a fragmented set of tools (orchestrators, model registries), which requires significant DevOps expertise and slows down the model lifecycle.

**Vision**: To make MLOps as easy as having a conversation. We will build a conversational agent that acts as a single, intelligent interface to the MLOps stack, abstracting away the underlying complexity.

**MVP Scope**: This document outlines an MVP to demonstrate the core value of this agent. It will orchestrate a local MLOps stack consisting of **Prefect** for pipeline orchestration and **MLflow** for experiment tracking, all through a conversational React UI powered by a GPT-class LLM.

---
### 2. Goals and Objectives

* Demonstrate the feasibility and power of a conversational interface for MLOps.
* Showcase a seamless, end-to-end workflow from script upload to a registered model.
* Provide a "wow" factor by simplifying complex MLOps tasks into simple commands.
* Validate the core architecture (React UI + LangGraph Agent + Prefect + MLflow).

---
### 3. Target Audience

* **Primary Persona**: A **Data Scientist** or **ML Engineer** who is skilled in building models but less experienced with infrastructure and MLOps tooling.
* **Secondary Persona**: An **Engineering Manager** or **Tech Lead** who wants to standardize MLOps practices and increase team productivity.

---
### 4. Core Use Cases & User Stories

This MVP will focus on two fundamental MLOps workflows:

**Use Case 1: Pipeline Onboarding and First Run**
> *As a Data Scientist, I want to provide my finished pipeline script to the agent, so that it can automatically set up and run a new, executable MLOps pipeline without me needing to learn the Prefect API or manually configure anything.*

**Use Case 2: Model Retraining and Management**
> *As an ML Engineer, I want to use simple commands to trigger model retraining, check its performance, and promote it, so that I can manage the model lifecycle efficiently from a single interface.*

---
### 5. Features and Requirements

The agent will be accessible via a React front end.

#### **Use Case 1: Features for Pipeline Onboarding**
1.  **Project Initiation**: The user can start a new project via a command (e.g., `"set up a new churn model pipeline"`).
2.  **Single File Upload**:
    * The agent must prompt the user to upload their single, self-contained pipeline script (`pipeline.py`).
    * The React UI must provide a file upload component.
3.  **Pipeline Registration**:
    * The agent must have a tool that takes the uploaded `pipeline.py` and registers the defined flow with the Prefect server.
4.  **Trigger First Run**:
    * After successful registration, the agent must have a tool to trigger the first run of this new Prefect flow.
5.  **Conversational Feedback**: The agent must provide clear status updates in the UI (e.g., `"File received."`, `"Pipeline registered."`, `"Kicking off the first run."`).

#### **Use Case 2: Features for Retraining and Management**
1.  **Trigger Retraining**: The user can start a run of an existing pipeline via a command (e.g., `"retrain the churn model"`). The agent must have a tool to trigger the corresponding Prefect flow.
2.  **Query Model Performance**: The user can ask for results from the last run (e.g., `"what was the accuracy?"`).
    * The agent must have a tool to connect to the MLflow server.
    * This tool must be able to query the latest run for a specific experiment and retrieve its metrics.
3.  **Promote Model**: The user can ask the agent to promote a model (e.g., `"promote this version to staging"`).
    * The agent must have a tool that connects to the MLflow Model Registry.
    * This tool must be able to transition the latest model version to a specified stage (e.g., "Staging").
4.  **Conversational Feedback**: The agent must display the queried metrics and confirm successful actions (e.g., `"The last run achieved an accuracy of 94.2%."`, `"Done. Model v1.2 is now in Staging."`).

---
### 6. Out of Scope for MVP

* **Infrastructure Provisioning**: The Prefect server and MLflow server are assumed to be pre-installed and running.
* **Git-based Workflows**: All code will be handled via direct file uploads.
* **Agent-led Code Generation**: The agent will not write or modify any of the user's scripts.
* **User Authentication & Authorization**: The MVP will operate in a single-user, trusted environment.

---
### 7. Success Metrics

1.  **Functional Demo**: A user can successfully complete both Use Case 1 and Use Case 2 in a live demonstration without errors.
2.  **Clarity of Value**: A non-expert viewer understands the benefit of the agent (i.e., simplifying a complex process).
3.  **Responsiveness**: The agent responds to commands and provides feedback within 3-5 seconds for most interactions.
