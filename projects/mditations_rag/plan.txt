# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Stoic Journal with Meditations RAG

## 1. Product Overview
- A digital Stoic Journal that guides users with daily prompts for reflection.
- Users write journal entries in response to prompts.
- For each entry, the system fetches a relevant quote from Marcus Aurelius's "Meditations" and provides an LLM-powered reflection.
- All data is private, encrypted, and ephemeral—entries are not saved after the session unless exported by the user.

## 2. User Journey & Onboarding

### 2.1 Landing Page & Onboarding
- **Screen 1:** Welcome message.
- **Screen 2:** Rationale behind the app, written in the first person ("I created this app because...").
- **Screen 3:** Privacy assurance—everything entered is private and encrypted.
- **Screen 4:** Interactive tooltips highlighting:
    1. The daily Stoic prompt.
    2. The journal entry textbox.
    3. The "I'm done" button (submits entry for reflection).
    4. The export button (download your entry).

### 2.2 Main User Flow
1. User lands on the website and completes onboarding.
2. User sees the daily Stoic prompt and enters their journal entry in a textbox.
3. User clicks "I'm done"—the LLM reflects on the entry (summarizes, detects emotional tone) and provides a relevant excerpt from Meditations.
4. User can click "Export" to download their entry, the prompt, the LLM reflection, and the Meditations excerpt.
5. System informs the user that entries are not saved and will be discarded after quitting—download is required for safekeeping.
